Perfect! I‚Äôll make sure to include **3 examples for each question that needs them**. Let‚Äôs continue with detailed, beginner-friendly notes based on your lecture PDF.

## ‚úÖ 1. UML Categories and 3 Examples Each

### üß± UML is divided into 3 categories:

| Category                 | What It Shows                                 | 3 Examples of Diagrams                                                               | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structural Diagrams**  | What the system is made of (the static parts) | 1. Class Diagram<br>2. Component Diagram<br>3. Deployment Diagram                    | Think of it like blueprints for building blocks ‚Äî what the system contains and how things are connected. |
| **Behavioral Diagrams**  | How the system behaves over time              | 1. Use Case Diagram<br>2. Activity Diagram<br>3. State Machine Diagram               | Shows the *actions*, *flows*, or *events* the system goes through.                                       |
| **Interaction Diagrams** | How objects/parts talk to each other          | 1. Sequence Diagram<br>2. Communication (Collaboration) Diagram<br>3. Timing Diagram | Think of it like a script showing how parts take turns talking and responding.                           |

## ‚úÖ 2. Software Quality Dimensions (UML Context)

In real-life UML-based projects, we care about **six kinds of quality**:

| Type                    | What It Means (Simplified)                                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Quality**        | Is the data accurate and reliable? (No typos, no missing info) |
| **Code Quality**        | Is the code correct and efficient? (No bugs, clean logic)      |
| **Model Quality**       | Are the UML diagrams correct, complete, and understandable?    |
| **Process Quality**     | Are the steps in development organized and well done?          |
| **Management Quality**  | Is planning, budgeting, and teamwork managed well?             |
| **Quality Environment** | All the above put together in a smooth system.                 |

## ‚úÖ 3. Model Spaces: MOPS, MOSS, MOBS

> Remember the 3 spaces: üß© **Problem**, üí° **Solution**, üèóÔ∏è **Background**

### üß© **MOPS** ‚Äì Model of the Problem Space

* Focus: **Understanding the user's problem**
* No programming yet!
* Used by: **Business Analyst**
* Activities:

  * Requirements gathering
  * Basic prototyping
  * Understanding business workflow

üìù **3 Examples of UML Diagrams Used in MOPS:**

1. Use Case Diagram
2. Activity Diagram
3. Basic Class Diagram (very high level)

---

### üí° **MOSS** ‚Äì Model of the Solution Space

* Focus: **How we will solve the problem**
* Contains **technical and detailed diagrams**
* Used by: **System Designer**
* Requires knowledge of:

  * Code
  * Databases
  * Web technologies

üìù **3 Examples of UML Diagrams Used in MOSS:**

1. Class Diagram (with attributes/methods)
2. Sequence Diagram
3. State Machine Diagram

---

### üèóÔ∏è **MOBS** ‚Äì Model of the Background Space

* Focus: **Architecture & Management**
* No direct UML diagrams for project planning, but some help indirectly
* Used by: **System Architect & Project Manager**
* Covers:

  * Hardware needs
  * Architecture patterns
  * Performance (CPU, memory, etc.)
  * Management tools like Gantt/PERT

üìù **3 Examples of UML Diagrams Used in MOBS:**

1. Component Diagram
2. Deployment Diagram
3. Composite Structure Diagram

## ‚úÖ 4. Verification and Validation (V\&V) of UML Models

To check UML diagrams, we look at **three aspects**:

| Aspect         | Meaning (Like You're 5)            | What to Check                                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Syntax**     | Are the rules followed?            | Is the diagram drawn correctly? Are arrows, boxes, and labels in the right format? |
| **Semantics**  | Does it make sense?                | Does it reflect the real system logic? Are actors doing what they‚Äôre supposed to?  |
| **Aesthetics** | Is it neat and easy to understand? | Is it organized, clean, not overcrowded? Is it easy to read?                       |

üß™ **4 V\&V Techniques** (usually asked in tests!):

| Technique       | What It Does                                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Walkthrough** | Informal checking (done by you or peer)            |
| **Inspection**  | More detailed, usually done by another team member |
| **Review**      | Group discussion, checks meaning and style         |
| **Audit**       | Formal, maybe external ‚Äî checks overall quality    |

Let me know if you want:

* Hand-drawn examples of any 3 diagrams
* Quiz questions to practice
* Flashcards
* Explanation of one specific diagram in detail

You're doing great so far ‚Äî let‚Äôs make sure you ace that test!
